## About <a name = "about"></a>
The project specifications were centered around modelling data using ActiveRecord validations and associations for a micro reddit app. The app is meant to facilitate the user to make several  posts and make several comments on a post. In this repository, the User model has a  ``has_many `` association to the Post model and Comment model while a post has both a ``belongs_to`` association to the user and a ``has_many`` association to the comments. The Comment model has a ``belongs_to`` association to both the user and the post models. No user interface was created as the requirement of the project was to test the validations and associations using the rails console.
